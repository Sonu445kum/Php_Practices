Constants are like variables, except that once they are defined they cannot be changed or undefined.\

PHP Constants:
A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.

A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore (no $ sign before the constant name).

Note: Unlike variables, constants are automatically global across the entire script.


Create a PHP Constant
To create a constant, use the define() function.

Syntax
define(name, value);

Parameters:
name: Specifies the name of the constant
value: Specifies the value of the constant

Create a constant with a case-sensitive name:

PHP const Keyword:
You can also create a constant by using the const keyword.

Example:

<?php
const MYCAR = "Volvo";
echo MYCAR;
?> 

const vs. define():
const cannot be created inside another block scope, like inside a function or inside an if statement.
define() can be created inside another block scope.

PHP Constant Arrays
From PHP7, you can create an Array constant using the define() function.

<?php
define("cars", [
  "Alfa Romeo",
  "BMW",
  "Toyota"
]);
echo cars[0];
?> 

Constants are Global:
Constants are automatically global and can be used across the entire script.

This example uses a constant inside a function, even if it is defined outside the function:

<?php
define("GREETING", "Welcome to W3Schools.com!");

function myTest() {
  echo GREETING;
}
 
myTest();
?>
